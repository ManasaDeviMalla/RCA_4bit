What is Ripple Carry Adder?
A structure of multiple full adders is cascaded in a manner to gives the results of the addition of an n bit binary sequence. This adder includes cascaded full adders in its structure so, the carry will be generated at every full adder stage in a ripple-carry adder circuit. These carry output at each full adder stage is forwarded to its next full adder and there applied as a carry input to it. This process continues up to its last full adder stage. So, each carry output bit is rippled to the next stage of a full adder. By this reason, it is named as “RIPPLE CARRY ADDER”. The most important feature of it is to add the input bit sequences whether the sequence is 4 bit or 5 bit or any.
“One of the most important point to be considered in this carry adder is the final output is known only after the carry outputs are generated by each full adder stage and forwarded to its next stage. So there will be a delay to get the result with using of this carry adder”.
